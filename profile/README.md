MESH Engineering & Software Co. is a technology company providing IT based engineering and software solutions for various industries.

# About MESH
MESH Engineering & Software Co. (MESH) is a technology and solution consultancy company founded in 2002 to present IT-based engineering and software services for various industries. MESH whose origin is marine sector where various engineering disciplines (naval architecture, electrics, mechanics, HVAC, metal works, etc.) are gathered and many different project actors are cooperating within dynamic business relationships, have gained the competence and experience to serve different sectors throughout the years. MESH's core business areas are Advanced Engineering services comprising mainly Finite Element Methods (FEM) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) on one side and development of smart engineering and business management software and systems customized for users' needs on the other side.

# Advanced Engineering
To realize above mentioned applications, MESH works with a strong team formed by people studied in different engineering disciplines such as Naval Architecture, Mechanical Engineering, Aeronautics and Astronautics. Team members have around 10 years of experience on advanced engineering applications for the static and dynamic analyses of fixed or moving offshore, onshore and air structures with Finite Element Method (FEM) and for hydrodynamic and aerodynamic analyses with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). MESH having their roots from marine sector is not only working for offshore structures but also provides engineering analysis services to their customers for onshore structures in industries such as building, machinery, aviation, automotive, etc. The aim of MESH's Advanced Engineering team is to provide services to their customers to enable them proving that the particularities of products or structures, which will be served for the people's use, are stable, reliable and can meet the requirements. For that reason this team uses the most advanced software tools and carries out the verification and improvement of engineering designs in every level. These engineering applications are mentioned as follows.
